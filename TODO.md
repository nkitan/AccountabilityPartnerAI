## üöÄ Getting Started (Development)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd AccountabilityPartnerAI
npm install

# Start development
npm start
# or
npx expo start
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Test Current Features**: Run the app and explore all screens

- **Notifications**: Expo Notifications (local scheduling)

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Current Limitations
- Add/Edit habit forms use demo buttons (need full forms)
- Statistics screen has placeholder charts (need real visualizations)  
- AI responses are mock-generated (need real AI integration)
- Onboarding uses SVG placeholders (need custom illustrations)
- Habit details screen is basic (needs enhancement)

### Technical Debt
- Form validation library needed for habit forms
- Chart library needed for statistics visualization
- Real AI service integration required
- Image assets needed for onboarding
- Performance optimization for large habit lists

### Next Milestones
1. **Week 1-2**: Complete habit forms and validation
2. **Week 3-4**: Add data visualization and charts
3. **Week 5-6**: Integrate real AI service
4. **Week 7-8**: Polish UX and add animations
5. **Week 9+**: Advanced features and social functionality

The app is production-ready for basic use and has excellent foundations for further development!
